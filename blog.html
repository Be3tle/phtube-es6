        <h1>Understanding JavaScript Variables and REST API</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for web development. It provides different ways to
            declare variables and interacts with web services through REST APIs. In this blog post, we will explore the
            scope of <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>, the use cases of <code>null</code> and
            <code>undefined</code>, and what REST API means.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope of var, let, and const</h2>
        <p>The scope of a variable in JavaScript refers to where in your code that variable can be accessed. In
            JavaScript, there are three main ways to declare variables: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and
            <code>const</code>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>var:</strong> Variables declared with <code>var</code> are function-scoped, meaning they are
                only accessible within the function in which they are declared.</li>
            <li><strong>let:</strong> Variables declared with <code>let</code> are block-scoped, making them accessible
                only within the block in which they are defined, such as loops or conditional statements.</li>
            <li><strong>const:</strong> Variables declared with <code>const</code> are also block-scoped and have a
                constant value, which means they cannot be reassigned once defined.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use Cases of null and undefined</h2>
        <p><code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are two special values in JavaScript.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>null:</strong> It is a deliberate absence of any object value. You can assign <code>null</code>
                to a variable to explicitly indicate that it has no value or is empty.</li>
            <li><strong>undefined:</strong> It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any
                value. It is the default value of uninitialized variables.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is REST API?</h2>
        <p>REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A
            <strong>REST API</strong> is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services
            over HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to perform operations on resources,
            which are represented as URLs. They typically return data in formats like JSON or XML.</p>
        <p>REST APIs are widely used in web development to enable communication between client-side applications (like
            web browsers) and server-side services, allowing data retrieval, modification, and other actions.</p>

        <p>Understanding JavaScript variables and REST APIs is crucial for web developers to build dynamic and
            interactive web applications. With the right knowledge, you can leverage the scope of variables and harness
            the power of REST APIs to create feature-rich web experiences.</p>
